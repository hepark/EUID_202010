##### React 공부에 앞서 <ins>Front-End 개발 학습이 필요</ins>하다🤯

+ 웹 표준(Standards) 및 접근성(A11Y) 이해
+ 구조 디자인 (HTML5 마크업)
+ 표현 디자인 (CSS3 스타일링 + 레이아웃)
+ 반응형 디자인 (RWD)
+ 인터랙션 디자인 (JavaScript + DOM API)
+ 비동기 프로그래밍(AJAX) 및 보안 이슈(SOP/CORS), 우회 방법(JSONP)
+ RESTful 웹 서비스 (CRUD + REST API)
+ 모던 자바스크립트 (ES 6+)
+ Git 버전 관리 & GitHub 서비스

##### [Front-End 개발 학습 로드맵](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)에서 Front-End 개발자가 갖춰야 할 역량을 확인할 수 있다.
여기서 React와 관련한 부분만 간략히 정리하면 다음과 같다. 
+ Front-End의 3대 프레임워크: React.js / Angular / Vue.js
+ React.js의, 
    - Application State Manager: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) [Markdown][1], MobX
    - Server Side Rendering(SSR): [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) [Markdown][2]
    - Static Site Generators: Next.js, [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
    - Mobile Applications: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)[Markdown][3]



[1] Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.

[2] Next.js is a React framework for developing single page and multi-page JavaScript applications and websites. It is an open source web framework that allows developers to create Jamstack as well as server-rendered applications by incorporating web development best practices into the framework.

[3] React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.

React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible.
